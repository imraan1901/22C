# Cholesky Matrix Decomposition

## Description
This is a program that reads in matrices from a Microsoft CSV file 
and outputs the Cholesky Decomposition of those matrices into a CSV file.
 All matrices are assumed square for this Algorithm.
 
## Uses
* Linear least squares
* Non-linear optimization
* Monte Carlo simulation
* Kalman filters

## Time Complexity
O(n^3)

## How to use
./main inputFile.csv outputFile.csv
